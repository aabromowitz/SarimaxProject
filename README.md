Playing around with the SARIMAX algorithm, to learn more about it, ARIMA in general, and Time Series

I found some web pages explaining the SARIMAX algorithm, and a page with some data that walked through their Analysis.  I'd like to make my own notebook following along their walk through, and doing some extra investigation as necessary.  
Since I'm pretty new to Time Series analysis and to the SARIMAX algorithm in particular, this would be a good opportunity to do some further research.

The repository contains the following files:
1. .ipynb notebook that I was doing my work in
2. The .csv file where the data came from
3. The .html file that I converted the notebook to
